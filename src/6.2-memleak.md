# Chapter 6.2. Memory Leakage Detection
Rust employs a novel ownership-based resource management model to facilitate automated deallocation during compile time. However, sometimes developers may interventionally drives it into mannualy drop mode and which is prone to memory leak. 

`rCanary` is a static model checker to detect leaks across the semi-automated boundary. 

We support the detection of the following two types of issues:
1. **Orphan Object**: An orphan object is the heap item wrapped by the smart pointer ManuallyDrop.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buf = Box::new("buffer");
    // heap item ’buf’ becomes an orphan object
    let ptr = Box::into_raw(buf);
    // leak by missing free operation on ’ptr’
    // unsafe { drop_in_place(ptr); }
}
```

2. **Proxy type:** A proxy type is a compound type having at least one field that stores an orphan object.
```rust
struct Proxy<T> {
    ptr: * mut T,
}
impl<T> Drop for Proxy<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // user should manually free the field ’ptr’ 
        // unsafe { drop_in_place(self.ptr); } 
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let mut buf = Box::new("buffer");
        // heap item ’buf’ becomes an orphan object
        let ptr = &mut * ManuallyDrop::new(buf) as * mut _;
        let proxy = Proxy { ptr }; 
        // leak by missing free ’proxy.ptr’ in drop 
    }
}
```

## What's behind rCanary?
Canary is a component of RAPx, and the overall architecture is as shown in the following diagram:
![Framework of type analysis.](figure/rcanary.png)

It can generate SMT-Lib2 format constraints for Rust MIR and is implemented as a Cargo component. We design an encoder to abstract data with heap allocation and formalize a refined leak-free memory model based on boolean satisfiability.

```rust
pub fn start_analyzer(tcx: TyCtxt, config: RapConfig) {
    let rcx_boxed = Box::new(RapGlobalCtxt::new(tcx, config));
    let rcx = Box::leak(rcx_boxed);

    let _rcanary: Option<rCanary> = if callback.is_rcanary_enabled() {
        let mut rcx = rCanary::new(tcx);
        rcx.start();
        Some(rcx)
    } else {
        None
    };
}

pub fn start(&mut self) {
    let rcx_boxed = Box::new(rCanary::new(self.tcx));
    let rcx = Box::leak(rcx_boxed);
    TypeAnalysis::new(rcx).start();
    FlowAnalysis::new(rcx).start();
}
```
The `start_analyzer` function defines all the analysis processes of rCanary, with two important steps being `TypeAnalysis` and `FlowAnalysis`, corresponding to the `ADT-DEF Analysis`, constraint construction, and constraint solving described in the paper.

# Running rCanary
## Invocation
Before using rCanary, please make sure that the Z3 solver is installed in your operating system.

If not, run: `brew install z3` or `apt-get install z3`, with a minimum version of 4.10 for Z3.

Running rCanary within RAPx is very simple, just enter the sysroot (root directory) of a Cargo program and run:
```shell
cargo rapx -mleak
```

> Note: Analysis will be terminated if the directory or toolchain version is not `nightly-2024-06-30`.

## Additional Configure Arguments
rCanary also provides several optional environment variables output sections for intermediate results.

* `ADTRES` 
  * Print the results of type analysis, including the type definition and the analysis tuple.
* `Z3GOAL`
  * Emit the Z3 formula of the given function, it is in the SMT-Lib2 format.
* `ICXSLICE`
  * Set Verbose to print the middle metadata for rCANARY debug.

> Note: These parameters may change due to version migration.
 
## Running Results on PoC
> For the test case, we chose the same PoC as in the paper to facilitate user understanding and testing.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buf = Box::new("buffer");
    // heap item ’buf’ becomes an orphan object
    let ptr = Box::into_raw(buf);
    // leak by missing free operation on ’ptr’
    // unsafe { drop_in_place(ptr); }
}
```

Running `cargo rapx -mleak`:
